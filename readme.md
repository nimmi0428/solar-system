## 1. üìñ Introduction

The **Solar System 3D Visualization** project is an interactive web application that allows users to explore the Solar System in a three-dimensional environment. Developed using the powerful [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library, this project offers a realistic and immersive experience where users can:

- Observe planets rotating around the Sun
- Watch self-rotation of each planet
- Interact with the simulation in real-time
- Pause and resume animations with a single click

Dive into the beauty of space with smooth animations and intuitive controls!

## 2. üöÄ Project Overview

This project primarily consists of:

- An HTML file that sets up the web page and structure  
- A JavaScript file (`solarSystem.js`) that creates the 3D scene, loads textures for planets and space, manages animations, and handles interactivity  
- Real-time controls powered by [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)

Using Three.js‚Äôs rendering capabilities, the project simulates the orbits and rotations of planets with realistic lighting effects and smooth transitions.
